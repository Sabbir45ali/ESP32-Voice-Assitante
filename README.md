## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

1. **ESP32 Code**  
   - The ESP32 is programmed to act as the intermediary between the user and the Gemini API.
   - Communicates via Wi-Fi to send and receive voice commands.
   - GPIO control for peripheral hardware.

2. **Python Interface**  
   - Python script for handling audio input (microphone) and output (speaker).
   - Converts user speech to text and sends it to the Gemini API.
   - Processes the API response and converts it back to audio for playback.

3. **Gemini API Integration**  
   - Connects to the Gemini API for natural language processing and AI-powered responses.
   - Handles API authentication and data exchange.
